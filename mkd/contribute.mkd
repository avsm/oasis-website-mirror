## Help spread the word

The best way to help the OASIS project is to use it, of course. From the
beginning, OASIS has been designed using real-life projects as examples to
define features. The first public version was the one matching the most
common requirements for the author's projects. It is now time to expand this
requirements to your projects as well.

* [Try OASIS](quickstart.html) on your libraries/programs
* If it doesn't work out of the box, 
  [fix the generated files](MANUAL.html#customization-of-generated-files)
* Once it works for your project, send 
  [us your fix](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?func=add&group_id=54&atid=293)
  for inclusion
* You can also 
  [advertise](advertise.html)
  for the OASIS project on your project webpages.
* Ask to be added to the [list of projects using OASIS](alreadyusing.html).
  Fill a bug with website as component, "project using oasis" as summary" and
  tell us a few words about your project in the description, 
  [start here](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?func=add&group_id=54&atid=291)

We really appreciate to get your feedback, through 
[bug reports](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?func=add&group_id=54&atid=291)
or 
[features requests](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?atid=294&group_id=54&func=add).

## Write plugins and tools

If your requirements cannot be fulfilled by the actual code, you can extend
OASIS features through plugins. For now, plugins development need to be done
with the OASIS source tree. 

* Get a copy of the OASIS source tree (see next section)
* Add a directory into `src/plugins/`
* Add an "open" statement in `src/OASISBuiltinPlugins.ml`
* Create a test into `test/data` and call it from within a test case (see
  `test/TestFull.ml`)
* Create your plugin

Writing tools is not yet very easy. You need to depend only on the content of
`src/oasis`, which should become a library soon. Theses files contain
everything needed to parse and extract information from an `_oasis` file.
You can also subscribe to the 
[oasis-devel mailing list](https://lists.forge.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/oasis-devel). 


##Â Get involved into development

The main page for development is the [project on forge.ocamlcore.org][]. 
You can browse the source code of the [project][] and of its [website][].

  [project on forge.ocamlcore.org]: http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/oasis
  [project]: http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=oasis;a=summary
  [website]: http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=website;a=summary

To get a copy of the source tree, you must use darcs anonymously: 

    $> darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/oasis

or if you have write access to the project: 

    $> darcs get scm.ocamlcore.org:/darcsroot/oasis/oasis oasis

Once you have the source code, you can pick a [bug][] or a [feature request][] to fix. 

  [bug]: https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=54&atid=291
  [feature request]: https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?atid=294&group_id=54&func=browse

You can send back patches using darcs:

    $> darcs send --to oasis-devel@lists.forge.ocamlcore.org 

or commit directly your changes, if you have write access to the project:

    $> darcs push scm.ocamlcore.org:/darcsroot/oasis/oasis

or with a [bug report](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/?func=add&group_id=54&atid=291).


To update the source code with the latest available version:

    $> darcs pull http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/oasis

or if you have write access to the project:

    $> darcs pull scm.ocamlcore.org:/darcsroot/oasis/oasis

Further documentation about darcs on [darcs.net](http://darcs.net/manual/)

## Translation

OASIS uses ocaml-gettext for internationalization support. If you want to
translate it to another languages, just fetch the `.pot` 
[files](http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=oasis;a=tree;f=/po/oasis.pot) 
and start translating.

Once done, you can submit a bug report or send
[us](mailto:oasis-devel@lists.forge.ocamlcore.org) an email so that we can
include your work into the next version of OASIS.
