This section provides information you need to get started. 

Begin with the [OASIS Quickstart](quickstart.html) which show you how to set up
OASIS for a single executable and library. You can then move on to the 
[OASIS User manual](MANUAL.html) to go in depth.

You can also browse the 
[examples directory](http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=oasis;a=tree;f=/examples) 
which contains additional examples how to use OASIS in your project. There are also
many [projects](alreadyusing.html) already using OASIS, you can take example on them.

Extra documentation can be found in the forge.ocamlcore.org project
documentation [section](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/docman/?group_id=54). In
particular, some
[slides](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/docman/view.php/54/94/SlidesCamlConsortium2009.pdf)
about OASIS design which was presented at OCaml Consortium meeting on December
4th 2009.
